# ðŸ”„ Resource Allocation Graph Simulator

A graphical simulator for **Resource Allocation Graphs (RAGs)** with support for:
- âœ… Deadlock Detection
- âœ… Deadlock Avoidance
- âœ… Dynamic Process & Resource Management
- âœ… Visual representation of allocation and requests

Built using **PyQt6**, **networkx**, and **matplotlib**, this project demonstrates how operating systems manage resources and detect potential deadlocks in real time.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This simulator is designed to help visualize, simulate, and analyze resource allocation scenarios typically covered in **Operating Systems (OS)** courses.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives:
- Implement **deadlock detection**
- Implement **deadlock avoidance**
- Drive the **graphical UI to control all interactions**
